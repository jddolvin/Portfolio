          I've always sought out opportunities that are meaningful to me, and
          taken on challenges that push me to learn more. Although my
          professional path has taken many twists and turns - from retail
          management, to production supervisor, to construction worker - I've
          never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
          As a web developer, I take advantage of my obsessive attention to
          detail and my mission-driven work ethic to change the world. That's
          why I'm excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
